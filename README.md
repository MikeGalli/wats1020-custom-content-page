I’m going to make a product page. For a long time, I’ve wanted a place to display and maybe sell my paintings. This assignment will be a good place to make 2 types of portfolio  pieces. One portfolio piece will be the web development itself, the other will be the paintings. There is a third part to the portfolio process; using this project; my future employers can look at me as not only a web developer. They will also have a chance to see that I may be able to contribute more.
This piece will be proof of concept for me: is this really how I want to represent myself on the web? How can it be improved? Along the way, I’ll delve into all the requirements of this assignment; all of which will be necessary for an actual professional web page.
One of the things I find annoying about web pages is the need to look for what I want. While looking through a site looking for what ai want, it’s necessary to try to figure out the mindset of the developer. How did this guy organize things? If there even is a system, are things cross-referenced so I can look for things in a way that makes sense to me? When I do web pages for myself (like this assignment), I will focus on minimizing the need to drill into things, and scroll around.
